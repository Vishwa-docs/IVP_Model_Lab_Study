# Questions
One from theory and one ML model will be asked
Eg : You need to do preprocessing and segmentation, just know what to do


# To Do
1. Go through LMS Lab Assignments
    - Extraction of Colour bands from an image
    - Adding Noise to an image - Uniform, Gaussian, Salt and Pepper
        - Removing noise (Blind and kernel known)
    - Metrics
        - Noise : PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio), SSIM( Structural Similarity Index Measure), LPIPS( Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity).
        - Task Dependent
    - Basics
        - PCA, SVD etc.
    - Morphological Transform
        - erosion and dilation with a circular structuring element
        - erosion and dilation with a square structuring element
        - closing and opening with a cross shaped structuring element
    - Mask Generation
    - Anisotrophic Diffusion
    - Fourier Transform

1. Look at standard datasets and tasks and list (Like MNIST)
    - Classification
        - Dataset: CIFAR10, ImageNet
    - Identification
    - Segmentation
        - By calculating a threshold setting using the histogram of brightness values.
        - Using adaptive thresholding
        - Using watershed algorithm
        - Dataset: Cityscapes, ADE20K
