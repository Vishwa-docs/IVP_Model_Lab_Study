# Questions
One from theory and one ML model will be asked
Eg : You need to do preprocessing and segmentation, just know what to do

# Rhea Git Repo (For Viva Theory + Model Codes)
[Link](https://github.com/RP-1106/IVP-ImageProcessing/blob/main/SET-2/Question.txt)
+ When finished, do the project

## Viva
+ **Read about Transformers, GANs etc**
+ Cnn vs unet
+ Relu vs leaky relu
+ Image restoration vs Degradation
+ Masking and Erosion
+ How Performacne Metrics work (PSNR, SSIM etc)

# To Do
1. Go through LMS Lab Assignments
    - Extraction of Colour bands from an image
    - Adding Noise to an image - Uniform, Gaussian, Salt and Pepper
        - Removing noise (Blind and kernel known)
    - Metrics
        - Noise : PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio), SSIM( Structural Similarity Index Measure), LPIPS( Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity).
    - Basics
        - PCA, SVD etc.
    - Morphological Transform
        - erosion and dilation with a circular structuring element
        - erosion and dilation with a square structuring element
        - closing and opening with a cross shaped structuring element
    - Mask Generation
    - Anisotrophic Diffusion
    - Fourier Transform

1. Look at standard datasets and tasks and list (Like MNIST)
    - Classification
        - Dataset: CIFAR10, ImageNet
    - Identification
    - Segmentation
        - By calculating a threshold setting using the histogram of brightness values.

        - Blind
    - Haze Removal
    - Face Detection (Eigen Faces, Viola Jones, CNN)
    - Object Recognition (Detection, Semantic Segmentation, Instance Segmentation)
    - Video Understanding (Abnormal Event Detection, Motion Modelling)
        - Video Classification : Kinetics, UCF101
        - Object Tracking :  OTB100, VOT Challenge
        - Segmentation : DAVIS, YouTube-VOS
